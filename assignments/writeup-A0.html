Your completion of this task will be graded based on your `test.a0.task2.problems.cpp` file and your responses to the below questions.

For each of the problems you solved in task 2, characterise the bug in your own words and explain one other scenario that may cause this 
type of bug.

Problem 1: The first bug was that str was defined as string instead of std::string. There was also a missing semicolon and a typo with cout. This type of bug would also be caused if you defined a vector as vector instead of std::vector.

Problem 2: The error was that dividing two integers causes the result to get rounded down to the nearest int, instead of being a decimal number. If you say double x = 3/2, you might expect x to be 1.5, but it will actually be 1.0.


Problem 3:
The bug is that end() returns a pointer to after the end of the array, instead of the last element. Let's say you wanted to iterate through a list in reverse, and you started the iterator at end(). Dereferencing the iterator to get the first element in the reversed array would be undefined behavior.

Problem 4:
The error was that the if clause had x == y == z but c++ does not support this notation. You must do x == y and y == z. A similar issue would occur if you wanted to check if y was between x and z and said x &lt; y &lt; z.
